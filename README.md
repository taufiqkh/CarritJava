CarritJava
==========

A Java API for the [carrit](https://github.com/taufiqkh/carrit) library, a chunk management library for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/).

Functionality is currently limited as the API is still under significant development.

Dependencies
------------
CarritJava is dependent on the carrit libraries.

Development
-----------
Pull requests may be accepted depending on the features/fixes introduced, the quality of the code and tests and how much time I have.

Compatibility
-------------
Designed for Compatibility with [MineServ](https://github.com/BuddaT/MineServ).

Planned Features
----------------
Obviously, the API needs to be determined and fleshed out before any significant development takes place. This library is intended as a thin wrapper for the carrit libraries, so no significant features are planned beyond properly exposing that functionality.
